# User Management Application(MERN)

## A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Welcome to the User Management Application, a comprehensive platform where users can register, authenticate, and manage their accounts. The application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, providing a robust and scalable solution for user management.

üì¶ Tech Stack:

- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user information securely.
- Express.js: Web application framework for building backend APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- React.js: Frontend library for building interactive user - interfaces.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.

## Features

üë©üèΩ‚Äçüç≥ Features:

- User Registration: Users can sign up for individual accounts,
 providing necessary profile information.
- Authentication Options: Supports traditional email-password
- Profile Management: Allows users to edit their profiles, update 
-Password Encryption: Implements secure password hashing techniques(#bcrypt) for protecting user credentials.
- Otp Verification: Sends verification emails to confirm user accounts and ensure security using Node Mailer.


## Lessons Learned


üìö Learnings:

- MongoDB Integration: Implements MongoDB for storing user data and leveraging its flexibility in handling complex data structures.
- React Components: Utilizes reusable React components for building a modular and maintainable frontend architecture.
- Express Middleware: Implements middleware for authentication, error handling, and request processing.
- JWT Authentication: Integrates JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and authorization proces
